# OnlineDataLearning

Here are some of my online learning accomplishments from DataCamp and DataQuest. I am actively learning and polishing programming skills and will update these folders with new achievements.

Also, in the DataQuest guided projects folder, you will find that I have jupyter notebooks of guided projects that I have completed. You can click on one and view my interpretations and process analyzing the data described in the notebook.
